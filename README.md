## Supported Datasets
Our framework supports the following datasets:

- VCTK

#### Downloading VCTK

You can download the VCTK dataset from the official website. Follow these steps:

1. Visit the [VCTK dataset download page](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2651).
4. Download the dataset (VCTK-Corpus.tar.gz).

Extract the downloaded file to your desired directory. For example:

```bash
tar -xzf VCTK-Corpus.tar.gz -C ../data
```

## Install Dependencies
Please install the latest numpy, torch and tensorboard first. Then run the following commands:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=.
# install requirements.
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo apt install -y sox libsox-fmt-mp3
```
Finally, install Montreal Forced Aligner following the link below:

`https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/`

## Download the pre-trained vocoder
```
mkdir pretrained
mkdir pretrained/hifigan_hifitts
```
download `model_ckpt_steps_2168000.ckpt`, `config.yaml`, from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n_0tROauyiAYGUDbmoQ__eqyT_G4RvjN?usp=sharing to `pretrained/hifigan_hifitts`

## Data Preprocess
```bash
# The default dataset is ``vctk``.
python data_gen/tts/base_preprocess.py
python data_gen/tts/run_mfa_train_align.sh
python data_gen/tts/base_binarizer.py
```

## Train
```bash
# Example run for Fluenteditor.
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tasks/run.py --dir /path/to/your/fluenteditor --config egs/fluenteditor.yaml --exp_name fluenteditor --reset
```


## Inference
We provide the data structure of inference in inference/example.csv. `text` and `edited_text` refer to the original text and target text. `region` refers to the word idx range (start from 1 ) that you want to edit. `edited_region` refers to the word idx range of the edited_text.

|  id   | item_name  | text | edited_text| wav_fn_orig | edited_region| region|
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
|  0  | 1  | "I'd love to be at the world cup." | "I'd <mark>absolutely</mark> love to be at the world cup." | inference/audio_example/1.wav | [1,3] | [1,2] |

```bash
# run with one example
python inference/tts/fluenteditor.py --exp_name fluenteditor
```

## Evaluation

```bash
# Example Objective Evaluation for Fluenteditor.
# You can use the following objective evaluation metrics: MCD, STOI, PESQ
python eval/get_metrics.py
```

## Tips
1. If you find the ``mfa_dict.txt``, ``mfa_model.zip``, ``phone_set.json``, or ``word_set.json`` are missing in inference, you need to run the preprocess script in our repo to get them. You can also download all of these files you need for inferencing the pre-trained model from
``https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BOFQ0j2j6nsPqfUlG8ot9I-xvNGmwgPK?usp=sharing`` and put them in ``data/processed/vctk``. 
2. Please specify the MFA version as 2.0.0rc3.
